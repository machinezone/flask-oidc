Project status
==============

This repo was forked from https://github.com/gerwout/flask-oidc since the change we need was not being merged timely.

The pull request in question was https://github.com/puiterwijk/flask-oidc/pull/144/files

The only custom change we've made is to merge and build this change as flask-oidc-mz so that we can use flask-oidc properly.
